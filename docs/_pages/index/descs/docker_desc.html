The template creates an Ubuntu AMI with a simple web app (built on top of Ruby / Sinatra) installed.
It also creates a Docker image with the same web app installed, and contains a <code class="nowrap-white-space">docker-compose.yml</code>
file for running that Docker image.
These allow you to test your Packer template completely locally, without having to deploy to AWS.
