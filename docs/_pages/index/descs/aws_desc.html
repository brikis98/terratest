  This example contains the Terraform module that deploys resources in AWS to demonstrate how you can use Terratest to write automated tests for your AWS Terraform code. This module deploys an EC2 Instance and gives that Instance a <code>Name</code> tag with the value specified in the <code>instance_name</code> variable.
  The EC2 Instance in this module doesn't actually do anything; it just runs a Vanilla Ubuntu 16.04 AMI for demonstration purposes.
