<p>
  This folder contains a simple Terraform module that deploys resources in GCP to demonstrate how you
  can use Terratest to write automated tests for your GCP Terraform code. This module deploys a Compute Instance
  and gives that Instance a <code>Name</code> with the value specified in the <code>instance_name</code> variable.
  It also creates a Cloud Storage Bucket using the <code>bucket_name</code> and <code>bucket_location</code> variables.
  Note that the Compute Instance in this module doesn't actually do anything; it just runs a Vanilla Ubuntu 16.04 Image
  for demonstration purposes.
