This folder contains a simple Terraform module that deploys resources in Azure to demonstrate
how you can use Terratest to write automated tests for your Azure Terraform code. This module
deploys a Virtual Machine and gives that VM a <code>Name</code> tag with the value specified
in the <code>vm_name</code> variable.

Note that the Virtual Machine in this module doesn't actually do anything;
it just runs a Vanilla Ubuntu 16.04 image for demonstration purposes.
