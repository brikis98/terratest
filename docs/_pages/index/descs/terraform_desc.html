<p>
  A very simple Terraform module to demonstrate how you can use Terratest to write automated tests for your Terraform code.
  This module takes in an input variable called <code>example</code>, renders it using a <code>template_file</code> data source,
  and outputs the result in an output variable called <code>example</code>.

  Note that this module doesn't do anything useful; it's just here to demonstrate the simplest usage pattern for Terratest.
  For a slightly more complicated, real-world example of a Terraform module and the corresponding tests, see <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/examples">more examples</a>.
