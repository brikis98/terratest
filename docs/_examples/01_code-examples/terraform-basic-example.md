This folder contains a very simple Terraform module to demonstrate how you can use Terratest to write automated tests
for your Terraform code. This module takes in an input variable called `example`, renders it using a `template_file`
data source, and outputs the result in an output variable called `example`.

Check out [terraform_basic_example_test.go]({{ site.baseurl }}/examples/tests/terraform-basic-example-test/) to see how you can write
automated tests for this simple module.

Note that this module doesn't do anything useful; it's just here to demonstrate the simplest usage pattern for
Terratest. For a slightly more complicated, real-world example of a Terraform module and the corresponding tests, see
[Terraform AWS Example]({{ site.baseurl }}/examples/code-examples/terraform-aws-example/).




## Running this module manually

1. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and make sure it's on your `PATH`.
1. Run `terraform init`.
1. Run `terraform apply`.
1. When you're done, run `terraform destroy`.
